=Make window-placement rules for floating groups too
=BUG: don't save window-placement rules, when _current_ group is empty
BUG: Troubles with etc folder (don't understand 'etcdir')
=Make different history for different input boxes
Make good modules autocompleting
+Add 'place-existing-windows' to macro 'recall-desktop-snapshot'
Rewrite 'migrate' in 'restore-group' function with 'convert-group' (not separate buggy code)
=Add PREF C-n/C-p/C-j/TAB onto floating group
+-Add 'gconvert' command - converts tiling group to float and float to tiling
+-Add window-placement rules to floating groups (added just to 'make-rule-for-window')
=Make 'abort-iresize' really abort ;)
=move from "/usr/share/dswm/" to XDG_DATA_DIRS/dss/dswm->/usr/share/dswm/
=move from "~/.config/dswm/modules.d" to XDG_DATA_HOME/dss/dswm-> ~/.local/share/dss/dswm/modules

=bug on clisp, when set-font
=bug on clisp, when load-module

=CLISP: (make-pathname :directory (list :ABSOLUTE "home" "zz" "qq" "s-bindings"))
=SBCL: (make-pathname :directory (list :ABSOLUTE "home/zz" "s-bindings"))
=CLISP: NO SLASHES!
=WORKAROUND: if platform not windows: make list with "/" as separators if windows - make list with "\" as separators

+make commands gmove-scratchpad,gmove-marked-scratchpad, bind this commands

FIX: sibling command

=BUG: Error In Command 'recall-desktop': error opening #P"/home/cosmonaut/.dswm.d/rules.d/desktop.rules":
=                                                No such file or directory
=with user euXXXX !


=FEATURE: port to CLISP,CCL,LW,ECL(CMUCL)

add command 'gselect-with-marked'

change: 'gmove', 'gmove-marked' don't changes current group
change: 'gselect-with-window', 'gselect-with-marked' changes current group

remove commands gmove-with-window, gnew-with-window, gmove-with-marked, gnew-with-marked, gnext-with-window, 
gprev-with-window and move it to module 'advanced-commands'


USE standard modules: s-bindings, advanded-commands, ql4ds. And use script deepshell as standard shell interface to 
DSWM


Make test for setting and unsetting font
