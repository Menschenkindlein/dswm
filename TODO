move from "/usr/share/dswm/" to XDG_DATA_DIRS/dss/dswm->/usr/share/dswm/

bug on clisp, when set-font
bug on clisp, when load-module

CLISP: (make-pathname :directory (list :ABSOLUTE "home" "zz" "qq" "s-bindings"))
SBCL: (make-pathname :directory (list :ABSOLUTE "home/zz" "s-bindings"))
CLISP: NO SLASHES!
WORKAROUND: if platform not windows: make list with "/" as separators if windows - make list with "\" as separators

+make commands gmove-scratchpad,gmove-marked-scratchpad, bind this commands

FIX: sibling command
